# IP-and-location-tracing-Web-Application
As a part of a coding challenge I developed a web application using PHP, JavaScript and MySQL. This application visualizes the geographical location and IP address of website's visitors. At the time of the visit, the visitor's geolocation is obtained and then stored into a database. An administrative dashboard will then allow users with the correct login to view a map containing markers for the location of all current visitors.
